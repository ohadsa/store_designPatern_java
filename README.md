# store_designPatern_java

The system manages the products sold in the store.
The products and the barcode were saved using the map collection.
In the system I built an iterator that goes over a file, everything is done according to an iterator template in a design format.
Using the Observer template, the system can send updates to customers who are interested in the updates and you will receive back notification of receipt of the update to the customer.
With Threads the system ran smooth and did not get stuck.
